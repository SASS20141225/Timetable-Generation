 
   Things to do:
  
   (1) Institute Course timetable -> formulation and implementation as parent time table
   
   (2) Work related to turbine -> every dept. has a separate login
		               -> accordingly, one copy of database needs to be for each dept.
		               -> user permissions and roles
			       -> upload history and other action's history for each user to maintain
				  a log and track down their mistakes if they blame on us
  
   (2) Generating student time table by getting the registration data ( to do at the last)
